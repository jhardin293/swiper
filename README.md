#About
Swiper is a flash card web app that allows the user to easily create, edit and test flash cards. The app uses a “Tinder” like swipe interaction to help the user test there understanding of a particular subject. The user can swipe right on the card if they understand or swipe left if they are unsure. The results and progress are updated in real time.

#Tech
The app is built with the M.E.A.N stack(MongoDb, Express, Angular, and Node) and Sass. It uses Socket.IO to sync real time updates. The design is fully responsive and is compatible with Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft edge.
